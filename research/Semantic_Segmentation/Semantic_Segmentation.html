	<h2>Deep Learning Method</h2>
	 <p>
	 
		<p> Based on Hypercolumns <br>
		<ul>
		<li>Hypercolumns for Object Segmentation and Fine-grained Localization. (2014) <br>
			This paper bring up Hypercolumns method and represente them as a neural network.</li>
		<li><em>PixelNet:</em> Representation of the pixels, by the pixels, and for the pixels. (2016) <br>
			This paper is based on above paper. There is another version of this paper: <br>
			PixelNet: Towards a General Pixel-Level Architecture. <br>
			There is another paper based on this work (use the same network to do different task): <br>
			Marr Revisited: 2D-3D Alignment via Surface Normal Prediction. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	 
		<p> Based on Dilated Conv <br>
		<ul>
		<li><em>Dilated-Net:</em> Multi-scale contest aggregation by dilated convolutions. (2016) <br>
			This paper use dilated Conv to connect coarse outputs to dense pixels.</li>
		<li><em>DeepLab:</em> Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs.<br>
			This paper use conditional random field (CRF) to do inference. The paper also use dilated Conv (Atrous Convolution) to remove several pooling layers. 
			The following paper (and its supplementary) is useful to understand CRFs. <br>
			Efficient inference in fully connected crfs with gaussian edge potentials. (2012)
			</li>
			<li><em>PSPNet:</em> Pyramid Scene Parsing Network. (2017) <br>
			This paper based on Dilated-Net and use Deconv at the same time. This paper also bring up a Pyramid Pooling Module.</li>
			<li><em>ICNet:</em> ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images. (2017) <br>
			This paper based on PSPNet and use several ways to speed up this PSPNet.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	 
		<p> Based on Deconv <br>
		<ul>
		<li><em>U-Net:</em> Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation. </li>
	    <li><em>FCN:</em> Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation. (2016) <br> 
			This paper compare three different upsampling methods (Shift-and-stitch, dilated Conv and deconv). 
			It also discuess two different trianing methods (patchwise training and full convolutional training).
			The network is difficult to train, so it bring up the multi-stage training approach. 
			The following paper is helpful to understand Shift-and-stitch method. <br>
			Fast image scanning with deep max-pooling convolutional neural networks. (2013) <br>
			For the decov, please refer these two papers: <br>
			Adaptive deconvolutional networks for mid and high level feature learning. (2011) <br>
			Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks. (2014)
			<!-- <p align="center"> <img src="./img/SRCNN.jpg" width="480" height="200" > </p> -->
			</li>
		<li><em>DeconvNet:</em> Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation. (2015) <br>
			The proposed network is very similiar with U-Net. It has Convolution network (modified VGG-16) and Deconvolution network. It also use unpooling layers and
			analyse the different functions with deconvolution layers. This paper use <em>two-stage training method</em> which train the network with easy examples first and 
			fine-tune the trained network with hard examples.</li>	
		<li><em>SegNet:</em> A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation. <br>
			This SegNet has a similiar network structure with U-Net and DeconvNet. However, it uses a different upsample method. In encoder network, the locations of the maximum feature value in each pooling
			window is memorized for each encoder feature map. In decoder network upsamples its input feature map(s) using the memorized max-pooling indices from the corresponding encoder feature map(s). 
			These feature maps are then convolved with a trainable decoder filter bank to produce dense feature maps.</li>
		<li><em>ENet:</em> A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation. (2016) <br>
			This paper creat a deep neural network named ENet specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. It analyse several aspects to speed up the neural network and this analysis 
			is useful for us to rethink the structure of neural network. For example, it shows that we don't need to design the same number of layers in decoder part comparing 
			with encoder part.</li>
		<li><em>ERFNet:</em> Efficient ConvNet for Real-time Semantic Segmentation. (2017) <br>
			This paper bring up a real-time semantic segmentation network and they use similar ways to speed up calculation with ENet.</li>
		<li><em>RefineNet:</em> Multi-Path Refinement Networks for High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation. (2016) <br>
			This paper use multi-path to connect low-level and high-level features.</li>
		<li><em>FRRN:</em> Full-Resolution Residual Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Street Scenes. (2016) <br>
			This paper combines multi-scale context with pixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network:
			One stream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries.
			The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. 
			The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals.</li>
		<li><em>LinkNet:</em> Exploiting Encoder Representations for Efficient Semantic Segmentation. (2017) <br>
			This paper design a small and fast network by linking each encoder with decoder.</li>
		<li><em>GCN:</em> Large Kernel Matters: Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network. (2017) <br>
			This paper proposes a Global Convolutional Network and Boundary Refinement block to address both the classification and localization 
			issues for the semantic segmentation.</li>
		<li><em>Tiramisu:</em> The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation. (2017) <br>
			This paper extends DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation and achieves state of the art.</li>
