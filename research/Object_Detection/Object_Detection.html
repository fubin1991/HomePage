		<ul>
		<li><em>OverFeat:</em> Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using Convolutional Networks. (2014) <br> 
			This paper develops several useful technology include <em>offset max-pooling</em> and <em> combinng prediction</em> 
			(they claim this approach is better than NMS). This paper also talk about multi-scale training.</li>
		<li><em>R-CNN:</em> Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation. (2014) <br> 
			Region proposal (selective search) -> Feature extraction (AlexNet) -> SVM -> Bounding-box regression. <br>
			This is a multi-stage network, we need seperately to train Feature extraction, SVM and Bounding-box regression. 
			The speed of this method is 47s/image.</li>
		<li><em>SPPnet:</em> Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition. (2015) <br>
			This paper use SPP to speed up classification and detection time. It also brings up a multi-size training method. 
			The SPPnet method computes a convolutional feature map for the entire input image and then classifies each object proposal 
			using a feature vector extracted from the shared feature map.For single scale input, the flow is: <br>
			Region proposal (selective search) -> Feature extraction for full image (AlexNet) -> SPP for every window -> FC -> SVM -> Bounding-box regression <br>
			This method can handle different size input images by using pooling (size and stride). However, this method is also a multi-stage network.</li>
