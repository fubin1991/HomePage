			This paper aim to address the network compression problem by taking advantage of depth. It propose a novel approach to train thin and deep networks, called FitNets, 
			to compress wide and shallower (but still deep) networks. The method is rooted in the recently proposed Knowledge Distillation (KD) and extends the idea to allow for thinner and deeper student 
			models. It introduce intermediate-level hints from the teacher hidden layers to guide the training process of the student, i.e., want the student network (FitNet) to learn an intermediate representation 
			that is predictive of the intermediate representations of the teacher network. Hints allow the training of thinner and deeper networks.</li>

		<li>Like What You Like: Knowledge Distill via Neuron Selectivity Transfer. (2017) <br>
			This paper propose a novel knowledge transfer method by treating it as a distribution matching problem. Particularly, it match the distributions of neuron selectivity patterns 
			between teacher and student networks. To achieve this goal, it devises a new KT loss function by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric between these 
			distributions combined with the original loss function. <br>
			In the other word, this paper add a MMD loss term to the loss function of FitNets.</li>

			This paper reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our 
			method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant 
			connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections.</li>
