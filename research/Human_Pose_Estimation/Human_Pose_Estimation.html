		<li><em>IEF:</em> Human Pose Estimation via Deep Neural Networks. (2013) <br>
			This paper propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by 
			introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, this paper use a self-correcting model 
			that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process called Iterative Error Feedback (IEF).</li>

		<li><em>CPM:</em> Convolutional Pose Machines. (2016) <br>
			The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such 
			as articulated pose estimation. This is achieved by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks 
			that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, 
			without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference.</li>

		<li>Recurrent Human Pose Estimation. (2016) <br>
			This paper proposes a model regresses a heatmap representation for each body keypoint, and is able to learn and represent both the part appearances and the context of the part 
			configuration. The model combining a feed-forward module with a recurrent module, where the recurrent module can be run iteratively to increase the effective 
			receptive field of the network and thus improve the performance.</li>

		<li>Structured Feature Learning for Pose Estimation. (2016 CVPR) &#9787 <br>
			This paper use CNN to obtain the feature map of each body joint and then use a <em>bi-directional tree</em> with stacked transform kernels to pass information about near neighbor joint.
			The final feature maps are obtained by concatenating two updated feature maps of bi-directional tree. The score map of joint k is predicted from the combined feature maps 
			through 1*1 convolution across feature maps.</li>

		<li>Multi-Context Attention for Human Pose Estimation. (2017) &#9787 <br>
			This paper propose to incorporate convolutional neural networks with a multi-context attention mechanism into an end-to-end framework for human pose estimation. 
			This paper adopt <em>stacked hourglass networks</em> to generate attention maps from features at multiple resolutions with various semantics. The <em>Conditional Random Field (CRF)</em> is 
			utilized to model the correlations among neighboring regions in the attention map. This paper further combine the <em>holistic attention model</em>, which focuses on the global consistency 
			of the full human body, and the body part attention model, which focuses on the detailed description for different body parts. Additionally, this paper design novel <em>Hourglass 
			Residual Units (HRUs)</em> to increase the receptive field of the network. </li>

		<li>Associative Embedding: End-to-End Learning for Joint Detection and Grouping. (2016) &#9787 <br>
			This paper introduce associative embedding, a novel method for supervising convolutional neural networks for the task of detection and grouping.
			The network outputs both a heatmap of per-pixel detection scores and a heatmap of per-pixel identity tags. The detections and groups are then 
			decoded from these two heatmaps.</li>

		<li>Learning Feature Pyramids for Human Pose Estimation. (2017)  <br>
			This paper design a Pyramid Residual Module (PRMs) to enhance the invariance in scales of DCNNs. Given input features, the PRMs learn convolutional 
			filters on various scales of input features, which are obtained with different sub-sampling ratios in a multi-branch network. This paper also provide 
			theoretic derivation to extend the current weight initialization scheme to multi-branch network structures.</li>

	<h2>Multi-Person Pose Estimation</h2>
	 <p> Top-down Approach: first detect individual people and then estimate each person’s pose.
		<ul>
		<li><em>RMPE:</em> Regional Multi-Person Pose Estimation. (2016) <br>
			This paper propose a novel regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation 
			in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. The framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose 
			Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), and Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG). The symmetric STN + parallel SPPE was introduced to enhance SPPE when given imperfect human 
			proposals.</li>
			<p align="center"> <img src="./img/RMPE.jpg" width="600" height="150" >
		<li>Towards Accurate Multi-person Pose Estimation in the Wild. (2017) <br>
			This paper propose a simple, yet powerful, top-down approach consisting of two stages. In the first stage, we predict the location and scale of 
			boxes which are likely to contain people; for this we use the Faster RCNN detector. In the second stage, we estimate the key-points of the person potentially contained in each 
			proposed bounding box. For each key-point type we predict dense heatmaps and offsets using a fully convolutional ResNet. We also use a novel form of key-point-based 
			Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), instead of the cruder box-level NMS, and a novel form of key-point-based confidence score estimation, instead of box-level scoring.</li>
			<p align="center"> <img src="./img/TAMPE.jpg" width="400" height="300" >
		<li><em>CPN:</em> Cascaded Pyramid Network for Multi-Person Pose Estimation. (2017) <br>
			This paper includes two stages: GlobalNet and RefineNet. GlobalNet is a feature pyramid network which can successfully localize the “simple” keypoints 
			like eyes and hands but may fail to precisely recognize the occluded or invisible keypoints. The RefineNet tries explicitly handling the “hard” keypoints by integrating 
			all levels of feature representations from the GlobalNet together with an online hard keypoint mining loss.</li>
			<p align="center"> <img src="./img/CPN.jpg" width="500" height="200" >

	 <p> Bottom-up Approach: detect individual body joints and then group them into individuals.
