	The purpose of person re-identification is to match pedestrians observed in non-overlapping camera views with 
	visual features. It has important applications in video surveillance, such as cross-camera tracking, multi-camera 
	event detection, and pedestrian retrieval. This problem is extremely challenging because it is difficult to
	match the visual features of pedestrians captured in different camera views due to the large variations of lightings, 
	poses, viewpoints, image resolutions, photometric settings of cameras, and cluttered backgrounds. <br>
	The typical pipeline of a person re-identification system is shown below: <br>

		<li><em>DeepReID:</em>  Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-Identification. (CVPR 2014) &#9787 <br> 
			This paper propose a filter pairing neural network (FPNN) to jointly handle misalignment, photometric and geometric transforms, occlusions and background 
			clutter. This paper also explain each layers into the traditional method.</li>

		<li><em>DML:</em> Deep Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification. (2014) <br> 
			This paper use a “siamese” deep part-based neural network to jointly learn the color feature, texture feature and metric in a unified framework.
			The network has a symmetry structure with two sub-networks which are connected by Cosine function. To deal with the big variations of person images, binomial deviance 
			is used to evaluate the cost between similarities and labels, which is proved to be robust to outliers. <br>
			It has a modified version of this paper, which is: <br>

		<li>An Improved Deep Learning Architecture for Person Re-Identification. (CVPR 2015) <br>
			This paper propose a deep neural network architecture that formulates the problem of person re-identification as binary classification. It include: two layers 
			of tied convolution with max pooling, cross-input neighborhood differences, patch summary features, across-patch features, higher-order relationships, 
			and finally a softmax function to yield the final estimate of whether the input images are of the same person or not.</li>

		<li><em>DGD:</em> Learning Deep Feature Representations with Domain Guided Dropout for Person Re-identification. (CVPR 2016) &#9787 <br>
			This paper propose a <em>Domain Guided Dropout</em> algorithm to improve the feature learning procedure. This paper first mix all the domains together and train 
			a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get a strong baseline. After the baseline model is trained jointly with datasets of all the domains, we replace 
			the standard Dropout with the Domain Guided Dropout and resume the training for several epochs.</li>

		<li>Person Re-Identification by Multi-Channel Parts-Based CNN with Improved Triplet Loss Function. (CVPR 2017) <br>
			This paper propose a novel <em> multi-channel parts-based </em> convolutional neural network (CNN) model under the triplet framework 
			for person re-identification. Specifically, the proposed CNN model consists of multiple channels to jointly learn both the 
			global full-body and local body-parts features of the input persons. The CNN model is trained by an improved triplet 
			loss function that serves to pull the instances of the same person closer, and at the same time push the instances belonging to 
			different persons farther from each other in the learned feature space.</li>

		<li> A Discriminatively Learned CNN Embedding for Person Re-identification. (2016) <br> 
			This paper combine two models (verification and identification) to learn more discriminative pedestrian descriptors. The structure is similiar
			with the DeepID (face verification) model.</li>
		<li> Re-ranking Person Re-identification with k-reciprocal Encoding. (2017) <br> 
			This paper regard re-ID as a retrieval problem. Given a probe person, we want to search in the gallery for images containing 
			the same person in a cross-camera mode. After an initial ranking list is obtained, a good practice consists of adding 
			a re-ranking step, with the expectation that the relevant images will receive higher ranks. Therefore, this paper introduce a 
			k-reciprocal encoding method for re-ID re-ranking. It consists of three steps. First, we encode the weighted k-reciprocal neighbor set into a vector to form the 
			k-reciprocal feature. Then, the Jaccard distance between two images can be computed by their k-reciprocal features. 
			Second, to obtain a more robust k-reciprocal feature, we develop a local query expansion approach to further improve 
			the re-ID performance. Finally, the final distance is calculated as the weighted aggregation of the original distance 
			and the Jaccard distance. It is subsequently used to acquire the re-ranking list.</li>

		<li><em>AlignedReID:</em> Surpassing Human-Level Performance in Person Re-Identification. (2017) <br> 
			TIn the learning stage, we have two branches for learning a global feature and local features jointly. In the local branch, we 
			align local parts by introducing a <em>shortest path loss</em>. In the inference stage, we discard the local branch and only extract 
			the global feature. We also adopt a <em>mutual learning approach</em> in the metric learning setting, to allow two models to learn better 
			representations from each other.</li>

		<li>Joint Detection and Identification Feature Learning for Person Search. (CVPR 2017) <br>
			This paper propose a new deep learning framework for person search. Instead of breaking it down into two separate tasks—pedestrian detection and person 
			re-identification, we jointly handle both aspects in a single convolutional neural network. An <em>Online Instance Matching (OIM)</em> loss function is proposed 
			to train the network effectively, which is scalable to datasets with numerous identities.</li>
