	<p>
	The purpose of person re-identification is to match pedestrians observed in non-overlapping camera views with 
	visual features. It has important applications in video surveillance, such as cross-camera tracking, multi-camera 
	event detection, and pedestrian retrieval. This problem is extremely challenging because it is difficult to
	match the visual features of pedestrians captured in different camera views due to the large variations of lightings, 
	poses, viewpoints, image resolutions, photometric settings of cameras, and cluttered backgrounds. <br>
	The typical pipeline of a person re-identification system is shown below: <br>

		<li><em>DeepReID:</em>  Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-Identification. (CVPR 2014) &#9787 <br> 
			This paper propose a filter pairing neural network (FPNN) to jointly handle misalignment, photometric and geometric transforms, occlusions and background 
			clutter. This paper also explain each layers into the traditional method.</li>

		<li><em>DML:</em> Deep Metric Learning for Person Re-Identification. (2014) <br> 
			This paper use a “siamese” deep part-based neural network to jointly learn the color feature, texture feature and metric in a unified framework.
			The network has a symmetry structure with two sub-networks which are connected by Cosine function. To deal with the big variations of person images, binomial deviance 
			is used to evaluate the cost between similarities and labels, which is proved to be robust to outliers. <br>
			It has a modified version of this paper, which is: <br>

		<li>An Improved Deep Learning Architecture for Person Re-Identification. (CVPR 2015) <br>
			This paper propose a deep neural network architecture that formulates the problem of person re-identification as binary classification. It include: two layers 
			of tied convolution with max pooling, cross-input neighborhood differences, patch summary features, across-patch features, higher-order relationships, 
			and finally a softmax function to yield the final estimate of whether the input images are of the same person or not.</li>

		<li><em>DGD:</em> Learning Deep Feature Representations with Domain Guided Dropout for Person Re-identification. (CVPR 2016) <br>
			This paper propose a <em>Domain Guided Dropout</em> algorithm to improve the feature learning procedure. This paper first mix all the domains together and train 
			a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get a strong baseline. After the baseline model is trained jointly with datasets of all the domains, we replace 
			the standard Dropout with the Domain Guided Dropout and resume the training for several epochs.</li>

		<li> A Discriminatively Learned CNN Embedding for Person Re-identification. (2016) <br> 
			This paper combine two models (verification and identification) to learn more discriminative pedestrian descriptors. The structure is similiar
			with the DeepID (face verification) model.</li>

		<ul>
		<li>Joint Detection and Identification Feature Learning for Person Search. (CVPR 2017) <br>
			This paper propose a new deep learning framework for person search. Instead of breaking it down into two separate tasks—pedestrian detection and person 
			re-identification, we jointly handle both aspects in a single convolutional neural network. An <em>Online Instance Matching (OIM)</em> loss function is proposed 
			to train the network effectively, which is scalable to datasets with numerous identities.</li>
