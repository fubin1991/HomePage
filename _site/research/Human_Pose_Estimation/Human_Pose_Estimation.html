		<ul>
		<li><em>DeepPose:</em> Human Pose Estimation via Deep Neural Networks. (2013) <br>
			The pose estimation is formulated as a DNN-based regression problem towards body joints.</li>

		<li><em>IEF:</em> Human Pose Estimation via Deep Neural Networks. (2013) <br>
			This paper propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by 
			introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, this paper use a self-correcting model 
			that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process called Iterative Error Feedback (IEF).</li>
			<p align="center"> <img src="./img/IEF.jpg" width="400" height="200" >
		<li><em>CPM:</em> Convolutional Pose Machines. (2016) <br>
			The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such 
			as articulated pose estimation. This is achieved by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks 
			that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, 
			without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference.</li>
			<p align="center"> <img src="./img/CPM.jpg" width="700" height="400" >
		<li>Recurrent Human Pose Estimation. (2016) <br>
			This paper proposes a model regresses a heatmap representation for each body keypoint, and is able to learn and represent both the part appearances and the context of the part 
			configuration. The model combining a feed-forward module with a recurrent module, where the recurrent module can be run iteratively to increase the effective 
			receptive field of the network and thus improve the performance.</li>

		<li><em>CPHR:</em> Human pose estimation via Convolutional Part Heatmap Regression. (2016) &#9787 <br>
			This paper propose a detection-followed-by-regression CNN cascade. The first part of our cascade outputs part detection heatmaps and the second part performs regression on these heatmaps.</li>

		<li>Human Pose Estimation using Deep Consensus Voting. (2016) &#9787 <br>
			This paper propose a novel approach where each location in the image votes for the position of each keypoint using a convolutional neural net.</li>

		<li>Associative Embedding: End-to-End Learning for Joint Detection and Grouping. (2016) &#9787 <br>
			This paper introduce associative embedding, a novel method for supervising convolutional neural networks for the task of detection and grouping.
			The network outputs both a heatmap of per-pixel detection scores and a heatmap of per-pixel identity tags. The detections and groups are then 
			decoded from these two heatmaps.</li>

	<h2>Multi-Person Pose Estimation</h2>
	 <p> Top-down Approach: first detect individual people and then estimate each personâ€™s pose.
		<ul>
		<li><em>RMPE:</em> Regional Multi-Person Pose Estimation. (2016) <br>
			This paper propose a novel regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation 
			in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. The framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose 
			Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), and Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG). The symmetric STN + parallel SPPE was introduced to enhance SPPE when given imperfect human 
			proposals.</li>
