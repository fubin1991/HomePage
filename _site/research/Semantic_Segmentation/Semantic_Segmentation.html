    <h1 id="research">Semantic Segmentation Reading List</h1>
	<p>
	Semantic segmentation is the task that requires classifying each pixel into one of a given set of categories. <br>
	We need a large field of view to do classification, therefore many people use 
	pooling layer and striding to reduce the feature map in order to obtain global information. However, this will lost details about the picture and these details are very important due to the semantic 
	segmentation. People try different ways to obtain global feature map and keep local details. <br>
	Althought we try to keep the local details, the semantic segmentation output of DNN is very smooth. In order to recover accurate boundary, people try different ways. The first approach is to harness 
	information from multiple layers in the convolutional network in order to better estimate the object boundaries. The second is to employ a super-pixel representation, essentially delegating 
	the localization task to a lowlevel segmentation method. The third is based on coupling the recognition capacity of DCNNs and the fine-grained localization accuracy of fully connected CRFs.
